=head1 NAME

lib::findbin - add paths to @INC relative to the directory the script resides in

=head1 VERSION

This document describes lib::findbin version 0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

These are all equivalent:

    use FindLib;
    use lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib", $FindBin::Bin/..lib";

    use lib::findbin;

    use lib::findbin qw(lib ../lib);

    use FindLib;
    no lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib", $FindBin::Bin/..lib";

    no lib::findbin;

    no lib::findbin qw(lib ../lib);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All this does is encapsulate simple logic we tend to do over and over and over. Its not terribly magical just simplifies things a little.

=head1 INTERFACE

That list defaults to (lib ../lib) if no paths are given.

Typically called implicitly via use();

=head2 unimport()

It take a list of paths relative to the directory the script is in and adds them to @INC as absolute paths. (Using FindBin for that).
